#### Incredible simple but powerful site template

Very easy content editing and management structure of the site (the site can be generated from a shell script!), static pages with great download speeds and the ability to host it anywhere, powerful JavaScript environment allows you to create a dynamic document without restrictions.

Very simple, you do not need to edit *HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, ASP, JAVA, PERL, PYTHON, RUBY* and a billion other technologies. Just open .html file and edit TEXT in it. The marked text you are reading is written as plain text. Open the 'View page source' and see it. But if you want these are the technologies they are still.
